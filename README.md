**42 C++ Piscine (C00 - C09)**

**Brief Description:**
A collection of my completed C++98 pool exercises. These projects showcase my progression in core C++ concepts and problem-solving.

**Skills Developed:**

* **Fundamentals:**
    * Variables, data types, operators
    * Control flow (if/else, loops)
    * Functions, parameter passing
    * Input/output 
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    * Classes, objects, member functions
    * Inheritance, polymorphism
* **Pointers and Memory Management:**
    * Dynamic memory allocation 
    * Understanding memory leaks
* **Standard Template Library (STL):**
    * Containers (vectors, lists, maps)
    * Algorithms
 
**Coolest things**
   * [Merge-insertion sort](https://github.com/dabel-co/cpp/tree/main/C09/ex02)
   * [Conversion of scalar types](https://github.com/dabel-co/cpp/tree/main/C06/ex00)
